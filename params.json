{"name":"PowerAPI","tagline":"A middleware toolkit for software-defined power meters","body":"Overview\r\n========\r\nPowerAPI is a middleware toolkit for buidling software-defined power meters. Software-defined power meters are software librairies that estimates the power consumption of software in real-time. PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different interfaces (filesystem, network, web, graphical).\r\n\r\n\r\nLicence\r\n=======\r\nPowerAPI is Open Source and available under the GNU Affero General Public License.","google":"UA-1723287-12","note":"Don't delete this file!
