Software-defined power meters are software librairies that estimates the power consumption of software in real-time. PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different interfaces (filesystem, network, web, graphical).\r\n\r\n# About\r\nPowerAPI is an open-source project developed by the [Spirals research group](https://team.inria.fr/spirals) (University of Lille 1 and Inria).\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgments\r\nWe all stand on the shoulders of giants and get by with a little help from our friends.
