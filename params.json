{"name":"PowerAPI","tagline":"A middleware toolkit for software-defined power meters","body":"# PowerAPI\r\nPowerAPI is a middleware toolkit for buidling software-defined power meters. Software-defined power meters are configurable software librairies that can estimate the power consumption of software in real-time. PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (*eg.*, physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different channels (including filesystem, network, web, graphical). As a middleware toolkit, PowerAPI offers the capability of assemblying power meters *«à la carte»* to accomodate user requirements.\r\n\r\n# About\r\nPowerAPI is an open-source project developed by the [Spirals research group](https://team.inria.fr/spirals) (University of Lille 1 and Inria).\r\n\r\n# Mailing list\r\nYou can follow the latest news and asks questions by subscribing to our [mailing list](https://sympa.inria.fr/sympa/info/powerapi).\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\nIf you would like to contribute code you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.\r\n\r\nWhen submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible.\r\n\r\n# Acknowledgments\r\nWe all stand on the shoulders of giants and get by with a little help from our friends.
