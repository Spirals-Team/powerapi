Overview
========
PowerAPI is a middleware toolkit for buidling software-defined power meters. Software-defined power meters are software librairies that estimates the power consumption of software in real-time. PowerAPI supports the acquisition of raw metrics from a wide diversity of sensors (physical meters, processor interfaces, hardware counters, OS counters) and the delivery of power consumptions via different interfaces (filesystem, network, web, graphical).
